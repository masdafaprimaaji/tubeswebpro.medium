(2, 2, 'Is There Anything I Can Do to Improve My Immune System?', 'The same aisle exists in pretty much any drugstore — the one with the powders, pills, chewable tablets, gummies, sprays, and drinks, all claiming to help you stave off or shorten illnesses.\r\n\r\nIt’s a comforting idea — that a heartier defense system is that close at hand — especially if you’re one of those people who always seems to be coming down with something. But as with almost all quick fixes, this one is mostly too good to be true. There’s no conclusive evidence that “megadosing” on vitamin C will keep you from getting sick. And while there’s some research to suggest that zinc supplements may help shorten the duration of a cold, they won’t prevent you from catching one in the first place.\r\n\r\nThat’s not to say there’s nothing you can do to build up your immunity over time — it’s just a longer, slower, more involved process. Like a gardener ripping out weeds and planting veggies, the immune system destroys harmful pathogens, promotes helpful bacteria, and maintains an equilibrium in the body. A host of things — certain illnesses, poor diet, aging, a sedentary lifestyle, stress, or a lack of sleep — can weaken your immune system, throwing the delicate balance out of whack. But certain lifestyle changes can strengthen your body’s defense, enabling it to better fight off disease.\r\n\r\nHere are a few things you can do to help it along.\r\n\r\nLower your cleanliness standards.\r\nAccording to Jack Gilbert, PhD, a microbial ecologist, professor, and the author of Dirt is Good: The Advantage of Germs for Your Child’s Developing Immune System, living in a sterile environment free of dirt or antigens can have a detrimental effect on the immune system, especially during childhood. “Your immune system needs to be constantly stimulated in order to be effectively healthy,” Gilbert says. “Bringing up a child in a sterile environment actually makes the immune system more likely to act out and become hyperresponsive.”\r\n\r\nA prime example, Gilbert says, is the health disparity between the Amish and Hutterites, two farming communities in the rural United States. In one 2016 study, researchers found that despite genetic and lifestyle similarities between the two communities, the Amish, whose kids spent time on the farm from a younger age, had fewer cases of asthma and allergies than the Hutterites, even though microbial samples from inside the Amish homes yielded more dust and bacteria. The so-called hygiene hypothesis — a theory also cited as a possible explanation for the rise of autoimmune diseases — holds that earlier exposure to a wider variety of microbes acts as constant stimulation of the immune system, Gilbert explains, making it more responsive.\r\n\r\nOf course, you were raised how you were raised, and you can’t go back in time to give yourself a childhood with more exposure to dirt. But even as an adult, making a few small tweaks away from constant over-cleanliness could help you become more illness-resistant: Cut down on your use of antibacterial soap, and consider adjusting your shower schedule from daily (which experts generally agree isn’t necessary) to a few times a week. Some doctors have even advocated for more eyebrow-raising behaviors, like eating food that’s fallen on the floor or picking your nose and eating what comes out. We all have our personal thresholds for squeamishness, but the fact is getting more comfortable in a world full of bacteria, rather than trying to scrub away as many as possible, can be helpful in the long run — you need the good ones to help ward off the bad.\r\n\r\nPay more attention to your diet.\r\nOne surprisingly critical ingredient for immune health is fiber. The bacteria in your gut, both good and bad, feed on the fiber you get from your meals. But when you don’t get enough fiber, those bacteria start to eat away at the mucus lining the digestive tract, triggering an immune response. (In one study, when mice were fed a high-fat, low-fiber diet and the mucosal lining of their digestive tracts thinned, their intestines became chronically inflamed.) A diet high in fiber — at least 28 grams per day for women and 36 for men, per FDA guidelines — keeps the intestinal lining thick and the microbiome balanced. “Soluble fiber has also been shown to help people recover from bacterial infections faster,” says Dr. Kathleen Dass, an allergist and immunologist based in Oak Park, Michigan. By increasing a protein called interleukin-4, the fiber helps stimulate the body’s production of infection-fighting T cells.\r\n\r\nConsuming a wide variety of plants supplies us with an array of crucial nutrients that directly enable the cogs in our immune system to function properly. Vitamin D and vitamin C, for example, have both been shown to stimulate the production of white blood cells. On the other hand, carbohydrates high in simple sugars can decrease white blood cells’ ability to kill bacteria. “You can never go wrong eating a diet full of fruits and vegetables,” says Dass.\r\n\r\nVegetarian diets especially have been shown to decrease chronic inflammation in the body, thanks to the antioxidant properties found in produce. “This effect can actually be shown by measuring an inflammatory marker called C-reactive peptide, or CRP,” Dass says. “Vegetarians tend to have lower levels of CRP than those who do not follow a plant-based diet.”\r\n\r\nGo for a walk.\r\nOne more way that exercise is beneficial: Research shows that even moderate activity can stimulate the immune system. Although the exact mechanism isn’t yet clear, scientists think exercise stimulates the body to produce cytokines, which regulate local and systemic inflammation as well as other immune responses. Evidence shows that just 20 minutes per day of moderate exercise has immune-strengthening effects.\r\n\r\nAnd if the exercise is outdoors, even better. “Just getting outside for a little bit each day will make sure you’re exposed to a greater diversity of microbes, and that can be beneficial,” Gilbert says. “Obviously, if you live in an industrial wasteland and you’re exposed to toxins or polluted gas, don’t go outside. But if going outside is not going to kill you, then it will actually help your immune system.”', 'Health', '2019-04-12', 'What works, and what doesn’t, in the quest to make yourself more illness-resistant', 0x6173736574732f64756d6d792f706f7374322e6a706567, 5),
(3, 4, 'Here’s What Brain-Stimulating Memory Enhancement Feels Like', 'The moment the researchers start firing electricity into my brain, I feel a repetitive pinching sensation on the left side of my head. It’s prickly and annoying, just short of painful.\r\n\r\nRobert Reinhart, a neuroscientist at Boston University who is demonstrating his research on me, assures me that the feeling will subside in about 30 seconds as the skin cells on my scalp get accustomed to the electric current passing through them. He’s right: The sensation soon downshifts to a persistent tingle — noticeable, but no longer irritating.\r\n\r\nThis makes it much easier to resume the memory test I’m trying to complete.\r\n\r\nI’m sitting in a chair in a little room in Reinhart’s lab, wearing a cap of electrodes and holding a video game controller in both hands. On a table in front of me is a computer monitor that displays a series of images, each one flashed on the screen for less than a second. I am shown mundane objects such as a book, an abacus, a glass of orange juice, or, more incongruously, a creepy clown puppet. After a few seconds of whiteness, another image briefly appears. It’s either a repeat of the first object I was shown, or it’s the same object altered slightly. Perhaps the book’s pages are splayed or maybe there’s more juice in the glass. I’ve been instructed to hit buttons on the video game controller to indicate whether the object is just as I remember it from its first flash on screen, or whether it’s changed. I see a green check if I’m right and a red X if I’m wrong.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, another test begins. A series of lines appear on the screen, slanted either slightly to the left or slightly to the right. That image is instantly scrambled by a grid of squares, and I have to remember if the original set of lines slanted to the left or right.\r\n\r\nThese various tests are assessing my working memory, which is the ability to hold information in your mind over a short period of time. Reinhart compares it to a sketch pad. It’s how you keep the first part of a sentence active in your mind as you read the last part. When your bank sends you a one-time code to log on to your account, working memory lets you remember it five seconds later. You likely won’t recall the code five days later, however, because other information has occupied the scratch pad by then.\r\n\r\nThe tests in Reinhart’s lab aren’t difficult; I get correct answers most of the time. So do most people. But age appears to degrade performance. Reinhart and his colleagues revealed in a study published April 8 that test takers in their 20s got 90% of the answers right, while subjects in their 60s and 70s got 80%.\r\n\r\n“It’s easy to criticize an emerging field before there’s standardization.”\r\nBut here is what’s remarkable: After the researchers began sending electricity into the heads of the older people in the trial, they started doing as well on the tests as the 20-year-olds. The improvement was still detectable almost an hour after the electrical stimulation ended.\r\n\r\nI’m halfway between 20 and 70 — young enough to assume I don’t need an electric memory boost, but old enough to respond to the news of Reinhart’s research with a hopeful pang. Is this too good to be true?\r\n\r\nOn the surface, this research sounds familiar. Other scientists have found that mild and noninvasive electrical stimulation improves memory and learning. It’s being tested as a therapy for people who stutter. You can buy headbands and headphones that zap your brain with frequencies that purportedly increase your neuroplasticity or relieve anxiety, depression, or pain.\r\n\r\nIt’s not clear, however, that those noninvasive methods work very well. They deliver much less energy than older (and more controversial) technologies such as electroshock therapy, and it’s debatable whether enough electricity gets through the skull to matter. Many promising findings from studies of noninvasive electrical stimulation have not been replicated.\r\n\r\n“I am not aware of any solid evidence base that suggests that noninvasive brain stimulation… really improves cognition,” says Joseph Devlin, an experimental psychologist at University College London. “I’ve even published one of these papers myself, so I’m not trying to be mean or disrespectful. After 20-plus years of working in the field, I’ve seen various trends come and go. This feels like one of those without staying power.”\r\n\r\nReinhart, a 39-year-old assistant professor, is well aware of this perception. He counters that many studies haven’t been sufficiently rigorous. Electrostimulation technology is cheap and easy to use, which means “anyone can just buy these things and start running [a] current and seeing effects,” Reinhart says. “Many of the findings are hard to believe.”\r\n\r\nHe’s designing his research to address those shortcomings. Reinhart believes neurostimulation is in much the same place where brain-scanning technologies such as EEGs and functional MRI were decades ago — before they became accepted ways to detect what’s happening in people’s heads when they’re performing various activities or thinking about certain things. “You see the same thing: There’s no standardization of the field, there’s lots of criticism — because there are replication issues,” he says. “It’s easy to criticize an emerging field before there’s standardization.”\r\n\r\nOne of the ways Reinhart’s experiment differs from past research is that he’s using smaller electrodes. This allows him to exercise more control over how the electricity hits the prefrontal and temporal areas of the brain. He’s also using alternating current rather than direct current, which means he can adjust the frequency for each individual. In his most recent study, people first had their natural brain wave patterns measured. Then, when the memory test began, Reinhart and his colleagues tuned their equipment to provide the same frequency, in hopes of nudging different portions of the subjects’ brains into sync.\r\n\r\nSome people get a placebo — “a sham current” that delivers the prickly sensation for a while and then subsides, without continuing to deliver electricity. But people who get the real electrical current receive it at the frequency that, at least theoretically, will align disparate portions of their brain on the frequency that’s optimal for them. People whose brains displayed tighter synchronization while being stimulated performed best on the memory tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine specifically what the electricity is doing to the brain, Reinhart’s group measured what happened when they flipped the current to push people’s brain waves out of sync. They discovered that the subjects did worse on the test. This indicates that working memory is directly affected by specific frequencies. “That’s really strong evidence,” Reinhart says.\r\n\r\nSeveral neuroscientists have called Reinhart’s research an intriguing step forward. Dorothy Bishop, a professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University, told me it was “potentially exciting.” But her use of “potentially” is key. In keeping with the elusive nature of this branch of science, everyone wants to see if the findings can be replicated and expanded to encompass more people, more memory tests, and longer observational periods before electrical tune-ups could even be considered as a therapy for the elderly.\r\n\r\n“The study showed improvement in one specific memory task over the course of an experiment,” Bishop says. “There was no indication that this would generalize to everyday memory, or that the effects would persist over time.”\r\n\r\nMy own experience wearing the electrode cap differs from what subjects in Reinhart’s published experiment experienced. Neither I nor the researchers are “blinded,” in scientific parlance: We all know I’m getting a real current and not a placebo. He and his graduate students also didn’t measure the frequencies my brain is naturally using, so instead of getting a custom signal, I received one in the middle of a common range. That means I probably didn’t receive the maximum benefit and might not have gotten one at all.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, for whatever reason, something changes after they begin zapping me. Before the juice started flowing, the tests had been getting tedious. After only 15 minutes of staring at the screen, I was getting tired of focusing so intently. But with the current flowing, I felt absolutely locked in. I’d even performed a little better on the test, though that might have been due to all the practice I’d gotten by that point. The main difference was how easy it was to focus on the flashing images, even as I kept up a conversation with Reinhart.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Reinhart published his April 8 paper, he began receiving inquiries from investors and entrepreneurs who want to apply his findings to a memory enhancement product. He’s so far ignored them. Although he’s pretty sure he’s onto something, Reinhart says the brain is nowhere close to being a system that can reliably be hacked. In fact, his latest study has left him with even more follow-up questions.\r\n\r\n“There’s a huge mismatch,” he says, “between what we know and what we wish to know.”', 'Science & Medicine', '2019-04-17', 'Scientists found that electrical brain stimulation improved memory among older adults in a recent study. I went to the lab to try it out myself.', 0x6173736574732f64756d6d792f706f7374332e6a706567, 6),
(4, 2, 'How a Homophobic Court Landed a Gay Inmate on Death Row', 'In 1974, a lonely 17-year-old boy named Charles Rhines, who lived in a small town in South Dakota, joined the Army. Rhines had grown up closeted in rural America. For many gay men of that era, military service seemed to offer a chance to prove their manhood and give them somewhere to belong. But for Rhines, enlistment proved to be an isolating — and harrowing — experience.\r\n\r\nJust months after enlisting, a playful twirl in the barracks appeared to rile up a fellow soldier who accused him of showing off his back side. Days later, according to Rhines, he was struck from behind while showering. He was hit hard; his forehead bounced off the hard tile wall, and he fell to the ground. Through the mental fog appeared his accuser and three other soldiers, who held him down and took turns raping him.\r\n\r\nRhines blamed himself for provoking the attack, his lawyer told me in an interview in November. He never reported it, terrified that doing so would spur more violence and humiliation, expose his sexuality, and might get him booted from the military, where it was illegal to be gay. Instead, he held in the pain. After receiving a general discharge following a rocky deployment to Korea, Rhines floundered in the outside world, where he turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the mounting stress. He became caught in a cycle: Poor coping skills turned his most traumatic experiences — abuse, stress, debt, crime, and jail time — into an insurmountable downward spiral.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Rhines entered a Dig ’Em Donuts shop, where he had worked until the previous month before being fired, in search of cash. Instead, he was startled by a former co-worker, 22-year-old Donnivan Schaeffer. Rhines pulled out the buck knife he carried with him and repeatedly stabbed Schaeffer, killing him. Rhines confessed to the crime and was sentenced a year later by a South Dakota jury to be executed for first-degree murder.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Rhines’ 1993 trial, the jury had revealed alarming bias, suggesting that his sexual orientation factored heavily into his sentencing. While deliberating his penalty, the jury sent the judge a list of questions about what prison life might be like for Rhines: Would he be permitted to “create a group of followers or admirers”? Could he “brag about his crime to other inmates,” especially “young men,” the jurors asked in handwritten notes to the judge. Would he be allowed to “marry or have conjugal visits”? The questions seemed designed to determine whether Rhines — because he’s gay — might assault or “convert” fellow male inmates, and whether he might actually enjoy prison more than death.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy appeals process delayed — but failed to reverse — Rhines’ sentence, the inmate this week moved a big step closer to death. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court once again rejected his appeal despite new evidence that raises a devastating prospect: Was Rhines sentenced to death because he’s gay?\r\n\r\nIn 2015, newly obtained juror statements revealed a layer of jury bias that was previously unexposed, leading Rhines’ attorneys to argue that he’s entitled to a new penalty phase hearing.\r\n\r\nAccording to the affidavits, one juror had called the defendant “that SOB queer.” A second worried that if Rhines were sentenced to life in prison, he could be a “sexual threat to other inmates and take advantage of other young men.” A third juror said “there was lots of discussion of homosexuality” and that, as a South Dakota farming community, “there was a lot of disgust.” Perhaps the most shocking comment came when a juror said during deliberations that, if Rhines were given life in prison instead of death, since he was a gay man, “we’d be sending him where he wants to go.” If there was any doubt about it, the new evidence makes crystal clear that revolting beliefs about Rhines’ sexuality played a factor in the most serious decision that can be made about a human being’s life at the hands of the state: the decision to end it.\r\n\r\nRhines’ motions to have these statements admitted were denied in a series of petitions, with both the South Dakota Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declining to intervene. Rhines still has legal options to exhaust through the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. But his latest rejected appeal undermines hopes that the courts would finally recognize homophobia as a clear form of discrimination in the jury room.\r\n\r\nJury deliberations are typically kept private. In 2017, however, the Supreme Court ruled in Peña-Rodriguez v. Colorado that if a juror has made “a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant,” the secrecy rule no longer applies. So far, courts have declined to apply that ruling’s protections to anti-LGBT bias, arguing that the history of racial bias in America creates “unique” circumstances that place it in a class of its own. But the NAACP itself submitted an amicus brief supporting Rhines’ motion for a new hearing, stating that it is “well aware of the unique role that race has played” in blocking equal treatment in the United States, but “just as the Constitution does not permit a person to be sentenced to death because of his race, it should not permit a person to be sentenced to death because of his sexual orientation.”\r\n\r\nAttention in this case has understandably focused on whether jury bias should, under the Court’s 2017 ruling about “animus,” entitle the defendant to a new trial. But it’s crucial to recognize that Rhines’ trial was the second time he was utterly failed by a homophobic world, and the failure during the earlier period of his life may have had the graver impact on his life — as it certainly did on Schaeffer’s.\r\n\r\nThe rape that Rhines blamed himself for in an Army barracks took place in one of the most virulently anti-gay climates in American history: the U.S. military during the Vietnam War era. (Full disclosure: The history described here is based on my 20 years of primary and secondary research and is summarized in a report I wrote at the request of Rhines’ attorneys.) The persistent, inescapable experience of trauma suffered by gays and lesbians who donned the nation’s uniform was born of both official policy and the social norms of a viciously anti-gay culture that viewed gay people with disgust. Thousands of gay and lesbian military members were systematically purged from the ranks during this period; many were thrown into military prisons for having consensual same-sex relations.\r\n\r\nEven those who did manage to avoid the clutches of military law still faced harassment, humiliation, and violence, including the constant threat of sexual assault, which was often perpetrated against those thought to be gay. The history of the era is replete with accounts of troops who, considered effeminate or gay, were derided as “fucking faggots,” blamed for slowing down a unit, and pummeled into submission as a way to “straighten out the queers.” It was too risky to report such abuse. Doing so could put victims at risk of further verbal or physical mistreatment, as well as investigation, exposure, separation, or prison — with consequences that would far outlast their military tenures.\r\n\r\nThe cumulative effect of all this festering anti-gay hostility was a poisonous and sometimes deadly atmosphere for gay and lesbian Americans serving their country, in which fear, distrust, and shame caused unimaginable stress and coping difficulties that could generate rage, substance abuse, and other destructive or risky behaviors. Recent research has shown that such stress has a deep, lasting, and even physical impact. A 2016 University of California study found that incidents of “minority stress” measurably increased the stress hormone cortisol in lesbian, gay, and bisexual subjects, thereby physically changing the brain. The findings suggest that stressors associated with life as a sexual minority can undercut physiological coping resources, impair judgment, and lead to a range of psychic health harms and destructive behaviors that can last a lifetime. A literature summary found numerous studies linking victimization among sexual minorities to mental health symptoms, including higher odds of depression and self-destructive behavior among those who were attacked or targeted for being LGBT.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court’s decision that racial bias is unacceptable in a courtroom should apply equally to bias on the basis of sexual orientation, which indisputably infected Rhines’ sentence. But Rhines’ case raises even bigger issues than jury bias. In taking Schaeffer’s life, Rhines committed an unpardonable offense. But the world repeatedly failed Rhines, and hence Schaeffer as well, creating harms that were avoidable and whose ongoing injuries — including the imminent prospect of Rhines’ demise — are also avoidable. Homophobia has proven deadly in the most literal sense, and it now threatens, needlessly, to take another life. When bigotry and neglect conspire to ruin so much for so many, what’s called for is mercy, rather than vengeance, for justice to be served.', 'Law', '2019-04-17', 'Charles Rhines claims homophobia led a jury to seek the death penalty — but the Supreme Court seems to disagree', 0x6173736574732f64756d6d792f706f7374342e6a706567, 6),
(6, 3, 'Settling the Credit Versus Debit Debate', 'Merging lives with someone is an adjustment. When my husband and I first moved in together, we were so used to doing things independently that we would butt heads often, even over small things. I liked falling asleep to The Office reruns, but he would toss and turn and wake up exhausted. He squeezed the toothpaste tube right in the middle, which is an abomination to me. Eventually, you learn to tweak your habits and accommodate the other person in your life. And this is true for your financial habits, too.\r\n\r\nBoth of your systems have merit. Your daily balance check-in sounds responsible and smart, and your fiancé is probably racking up loads of cash-back or travel rewards with his credit cards. Rather than expecting each other to adapt to your own ways of dealing with money, why not come up with an entirely new system together? Here are some options.\r\n\r\nSome couples keep one shared account for household expenses as well as their own individual bank accounts and contribute to both. If you keep separate accounts for your own spending (though you should still be transparent with each other about how you’re using them), you can continue to use each of your systems separately, too. If your fiancé wants to earn rewards, perhaps he could be in charge of budgeting for that combined account, and you could both pay into it from your individual accounts. This way, you can continue to budget as you have been, getting daily balance notifications, and your fiancé can continue to pay off his credit cards and keep track of the balances in his own way.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t like the idea of having separate accounts, you could try out each of your systems for a month and see which one works. Once the trial period is over, talk about what you liked and didn’t like about each other’s routines. Maybe you decide to go with one person’s existing system or maybe you pick and choose parts of each and combine them. For example, you could budget with credit cards like your fiancé does but then pay them off weekly rather than monthly.\r\n\r\nIt’s fair to be apprehensive about this if you’re not really a credit-card person, but there are a few ways to make sure you keep your spending under control in addition to paying the balance more frequently. You could use the credit card to purchase gift cards that have a limited balance and use those for your spending. Many credit cards come with their own notification preferences, too, so you can still get daily updates from both the card company and your bank to make sure you always have enough to cover your spending. Or maybe your fiancé agrees to stick to your system and only use the credit cards for larger purchases that you’ve already saved up for.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, if you or your fiancé decide to continue budgeting with credit cards, I strongly suggest you build a bigger emergency fund. If you’re worried about overspending, you’ll want a sizable fund to draw from just in case. This way, you can avoid spending money you don’t have.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the right path forward is just whatever feels best for both of you. Compromise boils down to three steps: listing the things you refuse to cede ground on, finding some things that are flexible, and then finding an overlapping middle ground among those flexible options. There’s no foolproof blueprint for handling finances that works for every couple. Most couples figure it out as they go along — kind of like the relationship itself. Be prepared to test and change your system as you find one that works for both of you.', 'Money', '2019-04-22', 'Ways to combine finances with a partner when you budget very differently', '', 3),
(7, 1, 'Unpacking the Trend of Natural Birth Control', 'When Layna was a teenager, she went on her first birth control pill: Loestrin 24 Fe. For a few years, she was content with her hormonal contraception. Then Loestrin was discontinued. She tried taking Seasonale, another hormonal birth control pill, but she found that it made her bleed when she had sex. Other pills weren’t much better: She experienced mood swings, gained weight, and even says she felt suicidal. “I knew in my heart that I did not feel like that, that that was not me,” she says.\r\n\r\nEventually Layna, who requested that her last name not be included for privacy reasons, decided to move away from hormonal birth control altogether, which brought her to the fertility awareness method (FAM), a collection of behavioral birth control strategies that help people follow and predict their cycles through period tracking, daily temperature taking, cervical mucus monitoring, and a lot of math.\r\n\r\nShe first tried Natural Cycles, an algorithm-driven FAM app that recently became the first app to receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market itself as a contraceptive. She says that app didn’t feel quite right for her, but she did stick with FAM. These days, Layna uses the OvaCue Fertility Monitor to track her fertile days, relying on condoms or abstaining from sex on days when she’s more likely to get pregnant. “I felt really strongly that it was one of the best things that I’ve ever done for myself,” she says.\r\n\r\nLayna is one of a small but growing number of women who are turning to FAM-related methods. Although data suggests only about 3% of women who use contraceptives use a form of FAM, either with or without other methods, app-based and other FAM-based systems are becoming increasingly popular. Natural Cycles currently boasts 1 million registered users worldwide, and similar newfangled FAM solutions, like OvaCue, Daysy, and Kindara are gaining broad followings, as well.\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to understand why someone would opt to use FAM, which requires substantial daily tracking, rather than, say, the copper IUD, which is 99.9% effective and, in some cases, can be used with little or no maintenance for up to 12 years.\r\n\r\nIn addition to rigorous period tracking and daily temperature taking, Natural Cycles, for example, requires users to either abstain from sex or use a condom on “red days” — the days when the app deems a person at risk of getting pregnant — a vastly more labor-intensive pregnancy prevention strategy than set it and forget it methods like the shot, implant, or IUD. Although the addition of temperature taking and cervical mucus monitoring can make FAM significantly more foolproof than the rhythm method, which relies on period tracking alone, the method still requires a lot of planning and mental energy — something that can be a deal breaker for many people. For people who want an effective birth control method without hormones, that work can often feel worth it: Natural Cycles boasts that, with typical use, its method is 93% effective, making it comparable to the pill. (Planned Parenthood is less optimistic about the effectiveness of FAM methods, rating them 76–88% effective on its website.)\r\n\r\nFAM is not an ideal method for everyone. Dr. Gillian Dean, the senior director of Medical Services at Planned Parenthood Federation of America says fertility awareness methods “don’t work as well for people with irregular menstrual cycles, people who can’t track their fertility signs daily, and those with certain medical conditions such as thyroid disorders.”\r\n\r\n“And it’s not a good method for people who don’t want to use condoms or another barrier method or abstain from vaginal sex on fertile days,” she says.\r\n\r\nBut for some contraceptive users, the appeal of FAM isn’t just about effectiveness rates or ease of use. It’s about finding a reliable contraceptive method that enables them to manage their fertility and reproductive health on their own, outside of a medical system that leaves many women, as well as transgender and nonbinary people, feeling ignored or misunderstood.\r\n\r\n“The best birth control method is the one that meets your needs, and those needs can change throughout your life.”\r\nWhenever Layna spoke to her doctors about contraceptive options, she says she felt they were more interested in jotting off a prescription than actually listening to her concerns about the side effects. “I definitely do have a bit of distrust for the medical industry,” she says, adding that her experiences made app-based birth control that more appealing.\r\n\r\n“There are doctors who believe that even the very well established side effects from oral contraceptives are just from the placebo effect and aren’t really that big a deal,” says Maya Dusenbery, author of Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick. That cavalier attitude toward contraceptive users’ suffering, she says, is a serious disservice.\r\n\r\nRecent research, however, is legitimizing the symptoms that many women have experienced and are expected to deal with while on hormonal birth control. A 2016 study of more than a million Danish women found a strong correlation between hormonal birth control and antidepressant use. “The risk of depression has been recognized since women were able to get their hands on oral contraceptives,” Cindy Pearson, executive director of the National Women’s Health Network, said at the time, adding that what’s changed is that there is now data to back up these experiences. “It makes sense biologically, and it’s been reported by women for 50 years.” Other recent research has questioned the link, finding no evidence of a cause of depression from progestin-only contraception specifically.\r\n\r\nPreventing pregnancy without barrier methods is a challenging task that is always going to come with tradeoffs; the nausea, weight gain, depression, and reduced libido that can come with hormonal contraception may feel like an acceptable cost compared to the option of an unwanted pregnancy. But researchers and doctors may take that appeal as a given.\r\n\r\nAll contraceptive methods come with their own list of pluses and minuses; even Natural Cycles founder Elina Berglund acknowledges that her app is most appropriate for people who are in their thirties; in a stable, committed relationship; and potentially interested in becoming pregnant later on. FAM apps seem unlikely to displace hormonal methods as one of the most popular ways to prevent pregnancy. But it may benefit the medical community to take heed of what’s attracting women to FAM in the first place; whether it’s fewer side effects or a desire for more reproductive knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Birth control methods are not one-size-fits-all,” says Dean. “The best birth control method is the one that meets your needs, and those needs can change throughout your life.”\r\n\r\nUltimately the growing use of FAM as birth control may signal an unmet need. And it could help open up an honest dialogue about the benefits — and costs — of all types of birth control, creating an opportunity to greatly improve the reproductive health landscape.', 'Health', '2019-04-01', 'Birth control options have never been more effective, diverse, or affordable — so why are many women favoring older methods?', '', 5),
